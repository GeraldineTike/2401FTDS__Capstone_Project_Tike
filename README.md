## 1. Project Overview

### **Why This Project Matters**

Rivers are vital for both ecosystems and human communities. However, pollution has significantly degraded water quality in many rivers, making it crucial to monitor and predict key water quality parameters. One of the most critical indicators of water quality is **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)** levels. In this project, I was hired as a **Data Science Consultant** to analyze contaminated river water parameters, with the main goal of predicting the **DO level** based on various physico-chemical features.

### **What I Did**

üîπ **Data Loading**      
I sourced and loaded a comprehensive dataset containing key water sample parameters from a heavily polluted river.

üîπ **Preprocessing**       
The raw data was cleaned and prepared to ensure it was ready for machine learning models. This step involved handling missing values, normalizing features, and more.

üîπ **Model Training**        
I developed and trained several machine learning models to predict DO levels using the available physico-chemical features.

üîπ **Model Evaluation**        
I assessed the performance of each model, ensuring the predictions of DO levels were accurate and reliable.

By automating DO level predictions, this project aims to enhance **environmental monitoring** and improve the management of polluted water bodies for better **water quality**.
