Buenos Aires Contaminated River Data Analysis
1. Project Overview

A data science consultant hired to analyze contaminated river water parameters. The primary goal is to predict the dissolved oxygen (DO) level of the river based on various physico-chemical features.

What I Did:

Data Loading: I sourced and loaded a comprehensive dataset containing water sample parameters from a heavily polluted river. Preprocessing: This step involved cleaning and preparing the data to ensure optimal performance for machine learning models. Model Training: I developed several machine learning models to predict the DO parameter based on the available features. Evaluation: I assessed the performance of these models to ensure accurate predictions of the DO levels.

By automating the prediction of DO levels, we aim to improve the understanding of water quality, enhance environmental monitoring, and support effective management of contaminated water bodies.

2. Dataset

The dataset consists of water samples collected from a polluted river, with various physico-chemical parameters measured.

Column Description sample_id Unique identifier for each water sample temperature Temperature of the water sample (°C) pH pH level of the water sample turbidity Turbidity level of the water (NTU) conductivity Electrical conductivity of the water (µS/cm) nutrients Nutrient levels in the water (mg/L) DO Dissolved oxygen level in the water (mg/L) - target variable
