        "**1.1 Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Environmental pollution, particularly in water bodies, has become a critical concern in many regions. In Buenos Aires, one of the most pressing environmental challenges is the contamination of rivers, which threatens both the ecosystem and public health. Monitoring water quality and predicting key indicators like dissolved oxygen (DO) levels are essential for effective environmental management and policy-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "Predictive modeling, powered by machine learning and data analysis techniques, can provide insights into water quality and help predict critical parameters. This project aims to develop a model to predict the DO levels of a contaminated river in Buenos Aires using various physico-chemical features of the water samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.2 Problem Statement**\n",
        "\n",
        "The rising levels of pollution in Buenos Aires' rivers have made it difficult to assess water quality effectively through manual sampling and analysis. There is a need for an automated system that can predict the DO levels, a key indicator of water quality, based on other physico-chemical parameters. The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict DO levels, thereby aiding in the monitoring and management of water quality in the region.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.3 Data Sourcing**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset for this project includes water sample data collected from various points along a polluted river in Buenos Aires. The dataset consists of several features, including Temperature, pH, Turbidity, Conductivity, and Nutrient levels, among others. The data has been split into training and testing sets to facilitate the development and evaluation of the predictive model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.4 Importance of the Study**\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Environmental Monitoring: By providing accurate predictions of DO levels, the system can help environmental agencies monitor water quality more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operational Efficiency: The automated system reduces the need for extensive manual sampling and analysis, freeing up resources for other critical tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability: The model can be adapted to monitor multiple rivers or extended to other regions facing similar challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data-Driven Decision-Making: Insights from the model can inform environmental policies, regulatory measures, and remediation efforts.\n",
